# R Package Build
A project to build my own R package.

## Description
This project contains code needed to build my own R package, based on the [Writing R Packages in RStudio](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/writing-r-package/) tutorial from [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io). I will go through the process of writing a very simple R package, uploading it to GitHub and downloading it from GitHub.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
